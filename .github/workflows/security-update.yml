              ## Security Alert

              Trivy has detected security vulnerabilities in our Docker images.

              **Action Required:**
              1. Review the security scan results in the Actions tab
              2. Update base images and dependencies
              3. Test the fixes
              4. Deploy updated images

              **Scan Details:**
              - Workflow run: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}
              - Triggered by: Weekly security scan
              - Scan Date: ${{ github.event.schedule || 'Manual trigger' }}

              **Next Steps:**
              - [ ] Review vulnerability details
              - [ ] Update Dockerfiles
              - [ ] Test changes
              - [ ] Deploy fixes
